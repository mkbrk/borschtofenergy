Borscht of Energy — Marketing Prospectus (Draft v1)

1) Concept & Positioning

What we are: A performance nutrition brand turning the classic beet soup—borscht—into standardized, athlete‑grade nitrate fuel.

Why now: Dietary nitrates from beets can increase nitric oxide (NO) availability, improving exercise efficiency and select performance outcomes. The category is crowded with sweet shots and gels; we’ll own the savory, real‑food niche with Borscht‑based formats athletes actually crave pre‑ and mid‑workout.

Brand promise: Real food. Real nitrates. No sugar crash.

Tagline ideas:
	•	“Fuel Like a Pro. Souped Up.”
	•	“Go Faster, Longer — The Borscht Way.”
	•	“Savory Power for Serious Work.”

2) Product Line (Phase 1)

All products are standardized for nitrate content and batch‑tested. Suggested nitrate content and use‑case below are guide rails for formulation.
	1.	Performance Borscht Shot (70–100 mL, shelf‑stable)
	•	Per serving: ≥ 400–500 mg nitrate
	•	Use: 2–3 hours pre‑session or race; also within a 3–7 day loading protocol.
	•	Profile: Clear, low‑fiber savory beet consommé (beet + lemon + dill), light sodium for palatability.
	2.	Borscht Mix (Powder Sachets)
	•	Per serving: ~ 300–400 mg nitrate when reconstituted in 250 mL hot water.
	•	Use: Daily training days / loading week; convenient travel option.
	•	Profile: Dehydrated beet base + natural acids + micro‑herbs.
	3.	Top‑Up Savory Gel (40–50 g)
	•	Per serving: ~ 100–150 mg nitrate + 20–30 g carbohydrate (isotonic).
	•	Use: In‑race “nitrate drip” every 30–45 min for events >90 min.
	4.	Recovery Borscht Broth (RTD, 300–350 mL)
	•	Per serving: 300–400 mg nitrate + potassium‑rich veg; optional 10–15 g protein SKUs.
	•	Use: Post‑session rehydration and refuel.

Formulation callouts (all SKUs):
	•	Use beet concentrate as primary nitrate source; optionally complement with high‑nitrate greens (e.g., amaranth/“red spinach”) for consistency.
	•	Include ascorbic acid (vitamin C) as a nitrosamine‑inhibiting antioxidant and to stabilize flavor color.
	•	Low fiber in pre‑race SKUs to reduce GI load.
	•	Sodium (200–400 mg per serving) for palatability and athlete acceptance.
	•	Informed‑Sport/NSF Certified for Sport targets from day one (critical for credibility).

3) The Science (for marketers)
	•	How it works: Dietary nitrate → salivary nitrate → oral bacteria reduce to nitrite → converted to NO (nitric oxide) → vasodilation, improved muscle efficiency (lower O₂ cost), better oxygen delivery.
	•	What studies generally show: Benefits for time‑to‑exhaustion, power output, some intermittent/high‑intensity tasks; mixed results on pure time‑trial race outcomes.
	•	Dosing windows (label guidance):
	•	Acute: ~6–12 mmol nitrate (~372–744 mg) 2–3 hours pre‑exercise.
	•	Loading: same daily dose for 3–7 days pre‑event.
	•	In‑race top‑ups: 100–250 mg nitrate per hour for events ≥90 min (product‑dependent).
	•	Do/Don’t that matter:
	•	Do not use strong antibacterial mouthwash within ~24 hours of dosing; it blunts nitrate→nitrite conversion.
	•	Do swish & swallow (don’t spit repeatedly) so the salivary cycle completes.
	•	Avoid over‑sweet flavor fatigue: savory profiles enhance long‑event compliance.

Athlete‑safe: Nitrates are not on the WADA Prohibited List. Choose certified‑batch products to avoid contamination risks.

4) Benefits (claim language for marketing)

Use compliant structure/function phrasing:
	•	Supports healthy circulation & nitric oxide production from food nitrates.
	•	Helps improve exercise efficiency (lower oxygen cost) and muscular endurance during sustained efforts.
	•	Helps you go faster for longer in training and competition when used as directed.
	•	Savory alternative to sweet gels/juices; easier on palate in long events.

Guardrails: No disease claims (e.g., “treats hypertension”). Include standard supplement disclaimer where applicable, or conventional‑food compliant wording for RTD soup formats.

⸻

5) Target Customers & Use‑Cases
	•	Endurance (cycling, running, triathlon, rowing): pre‑race shot + in‑race top‑up gel.
	•	Field/court & CrossFit™/HIIT: intermittent efforts respond well; pre‑session shot.
	•	Masters athletes (40+): emphasize joint palatability, savory format, and compliance.
	•	Altitude blocks & heat blocks: potential efficiency gains; pair with hydration.
